I am slowing coming to terms that I have little to no control of what will.

The past few months were nothing short of surprises, good or bad. Through various twists and turns, fate took me to where I am now: living in a bustling city in a cozy flat, while having a  fulfilling job in an environment where I can thrive and grow. Look back at the windy path behind me: puddles of tears I shed, stench of sweats that ran down from me, trails of blood from all the injuries that I endured. It is true: the only way out was through, and Fate was my navigator.

At times, I hated them. I could not understand why they would take me through such a strenuous path. Every moment of disappointments, exhaustions and heartbreaks felt like a dead end, and it would make me question whether Fate was sabotaging me. Fate is a patient one, however. Despite my doubts, they remained undeterred, and fought through all the troubles together.

Eventually, we saw light. The light came from a peaceful sanctuary where fellow travellers rest and heal before they move on. Before we could enter, Fate said:

"Before we could enter, you must give up something that is dear to you. What you give up changes the path that the Sanctuary leads you. I get to decide what it is, but you can trus that I will make the best decision for you."

Before I could open my mouth, Fate did it. They put their hands straight through my chest, and ripped away my heart. They placed it on the alter before the Sanctuary. The gates slowly widened as my heart evaporated into thin air.

Now, Fate and I are in the Sanctuary. I am healing from the missing heart that was forcefully ripped away and from the damages I took from the journey to here. I finally get to settle down and rest.

"We are slightly closer to the top of the mountain now." Fate told me, "enjoy your rest - you deserved it."

"Where are we going next?" I asked, to which they replied, "to your destination."

Fate is mysterious. Fate is unforgiving. Fate is also loyal, and only Fate knows the way. Tell Fate where you want to go, fight by them, and Fate will bring you there.
