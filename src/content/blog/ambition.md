Last year was wildly chaotic and transformative. Several life-altering events called for personal growth and self discovery. The amount of growth I have witnessed within myself was nothing short of astonishing. As a person who operates on self hatred, the fact that I was able to give myself credit took a tremendous amount of work. I am proud of the work that I had put in to be where I am now. I am proud of what I have achieved. I am proud of the grit I have built to power through mental hardships to get to where I want to be.

I want to express my gratitude towards all the fantastic people I have had the honor to meet this year. Every person played an important role in my growth, and I am grateful that we were able to cross path in our lives and exchange our experiences, even though some diverged again.

I have never been this excited and readied for a new year, and I want to extend my optimism for the new year to the readers. One goal I have is to release the project I have been working on for the past several months. I do not wish to share more details as it will demotivate me, but I have full conviction of it, and I will develop many useful skills in the process.

If last year was the training and the preparation for the marathon, then this year shall be the beginning. From now on, it is all about fulfilling my ambition. There is but one life chapter that is written - the final chapter of success. The rest will write itself as life moves forward.

Back to work.
