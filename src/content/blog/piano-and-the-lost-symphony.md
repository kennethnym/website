It was another dreary winter day in London. It had been months since I last sat in front of a piano. She had been yearning for my return, and I finally gave an answer. I stopped by at the coffee shop to soothe my chronic caffeine addiction, before I slowly inched towards the piano showroom with which I rented a practice room.

"One day," I thought to myself, as I navigated my way through the sea of pianos. Some were awaiting their owners. Some lucky ones found their new homes. Finally, I reached the practice room.

As I shut the sound-proof door behind me, I was teleported to another world. Suddenly, all my thoughts, my worries, my stress,  went away. Like walking into a Faraday cage, I was disconnected from the outside world. This world consists of the Kawai piano in front of me and myself, and no one else. "Welcome back!", she said.

When we play a piece enough times together, our bodies begin to fuse. The keyboard becomes the natural extension of my fingers. My vocal cord turns into the strings delicately struck by each hammer. Rather than singing through my mouth, I sing through my fingers, carefully orchestrating the vibrations of each individual string, to produce melodies that inspires and resonates. My emotions are on full display, through not just the orchestra of notes, but also my face. My body naturally follows the rises and falls of the song, like a passionate dancer dancing to the rhythm. It is a magnificent symphony on display.

Alas, life had separated us for too long. The symphony we built was lost, and it is now my duty to find the lost symphony.
